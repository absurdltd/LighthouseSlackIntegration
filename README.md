**Instructions to use**

To monitor the performance and load times on a site the config.json file requires two values:

**URL** - This is the url of the site you wish to see the performance of.

**SLACK_WEBHOOK** - This is the webhook of the channel you want the result to go to. Perfect for alerting you if there are any issues with the site.

**Running the code**

To run the report, open a terminal inside the project and type Node Main.js

**Continuous monitor**

This code can be hosted on a Devops pipeline and scheduled to ran as and when. This is one approach to continuously monitoring your website.
